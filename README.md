### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently with the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences at the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU), a PhD student. My main fields of interest are remote sensing based on high spatial and spectral resolution data for vegetation stress monitoring of forests and land cover classification in connection with other data sources. My main expertise is: multi/hyperspectral image processing, machine learning in EO data classification, and modelling of forest parameters.

My GitHub profile is not representative of my code quality. My code is usually hidden from the public.
