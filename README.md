## üåü Featured Projects

### [üöÄ TANABBO Forest Edge Optimization](https://github.com/alekseitrubin/tanabbo-forestedge)

Developed a Jupyter notebook for generating trap and antiattractant placement strategies using 30-meter resolution satellite data. This project enhances pest management in forestry by optimizing trap placements, leveraging spatial analysis and automation.

**Features:**

- Customizable trap spacing and edge detection for strategic placement.
- Visualization maps for proposed placements.
- Automation scripts to streamline the workflow.

### [üå≤ LiDAR-based Biomass Estimation](https://github.com/alekseitrubin/LiDAR-biomass)

Created a workflow to process LiDAR `.laz` files for generating Canopy Height Models and producing shapefiles for trees and bushes. This enables accurate biomass estimation and vegetation analysis using CloudCompare and Python scripting.

**Highlights:**

- Processing LiDAR data using CloudCompare in silent mode.
- Differentiation between trees and bushes based on height data.
- Area calculation for biomass estimation.
